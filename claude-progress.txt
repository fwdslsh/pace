# Session 1: Project Initialization

## Overview
Started the "pace-cleanup" initiative to improve code quality, remove dead code, and introduce linting/formatting standards to the `pace` CLI tool.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Dependencies:** @opencode-ai/sdk, (planned) eslint, prettier

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed existing `package.json` and project structure.
2. Created `init.sh` to handle dependency installation and building.
3. Created `feature_list.json` with 50+ granular tasks focused on linting, dead code removal, and testing.
4. Validated `init.sh` execution.

## Next Steps
The next agent should begin by picking a feature from `feature_list.json`, likely starting with the infrastructure setup (INF-001) to install the necessary tooling.

## Current Status
- Project initialized.
- 0/50 features passing.
- Environment ready for "coding-agent".
