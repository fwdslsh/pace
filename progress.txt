# Session 1: Project Initialization

## Overview
Started the "pace-cleanup" initiative to improve code quality, remove dead code, and introduce linting/formatting standards to the `pace` CLI tool.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Dependencies:** @opencode-ai/sdk, (planned) eslint, prettier

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed existing `package.json` and project structure.
2. Created `init.sh` to handle dependency installation and building.
3. Created `feature_list.json` with 54 granular tasks focused on linting, dead code removal, and testing.
4. Validated `init.sh` execution.

## Next Steps
The next agent should begin by picking a feature from `feature_list.json`, likely starting with the infrastructure setup (INF-001) to install the necessary tooling.

## Current Status
- Project initialized.
- 0/54 features passing.
- Environment ready for "coding-agent".

### Session 45 - Refactoring

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- REFAC-001: Identify code duplication in feature-manager.ts

**Actions Taken:**

- Analyzed `src/feature-manager.ts` for repeated patterns.
- Identified 5 areas of code duplication:
  1. Inline priority order mapping repeated in multiple methods
  2. Priority values initialization repeated in loops
  3. Passing/failing increment pattern repeated 3 times in getStats()
  4. Similar grouping patterns in getFeaturesByCategory() and getFeaturesByPriority()
- Extracted `PRIORITY_ORDER` constant (replaces inline `priorityOrder` in `getFailingFeatures()`).
- Extracted `PRIORITY_VALUES` constant (used for initializing priority buckets in loops).
- Extracted `incrementPassFail()` helper function (reduces repeated if/else blocks in `getStats()`).
- Refactored `getFailingFeatures()`, `getFeaturesByPriority()`, and `getStats()` to use extracted code.

**Test Results:**

- `bun run lint src/feature-manager.ts` passes cleanly.

---

### Session 47 - Dead Code Removal

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- DEAD-007: Check for unused template files in src/assets/templates

**Actions Taken:**

- Identified all files in `src/assets/templates/` (5 template files) and `src/assets/SKILL.md`.
- Searched codebase for references to these files - found NONE in any TypeScript code.
- Analyzed that current implementation uses `src/opencode/agents/` and `src/opencode/commands/` for all agent and command definitions.
- Confirmed these were legacy files from an earlier architecture ("WIP: starting refactor" commit).
- Removed entire `src/assets/` directory containing obsolete files:
  - `templates/CLAUDE.md`
  - `templates/feature_list.json`
  - `templates/init.sh`
  - `templates/opencode.jsonc`
  - `templates/progress.txt`
  - `SKILL.md`

- DEAD-008: Remove commented out code in src/cli.ts

**Actions Taken:**

- Scanned `cli.ts` (located at root, not in src/) for commented out code blocks.

  - JSDoc documentation blocks describing functions and types
  - Section dividers (`// ====...`) for code organization
  - Inline explanatory comments describing code intent
  - ESLint directives (`/* eslint-disable no-console */`)
- Confirmed NO commented out code exists in the file.
- Note: The feature description mentions "src/cli.ts" but the actual file is `cli.ts` at the project root.

**Test Results:**

- `bun run lint cli.ts` passes cleanly.
- `bun run build` succeeds.
- `bun test` passes (153 tests).
- `./pace status` works correctly.

### Session 50 - CI Setup

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- CI-001: Create a pre-commit hook (husky) for linting

**Actions Taken:**

- Installed husky v9.1.7 as dev dependency using `bun add -d husky`.
- Initialized husky with `bunx husky init` which:
  - Created `.husky/` directory with hook infrastructure
  - Added `"prepare": "husky"` script to package.json
  - Created default pre-commit hook file
- Updated `.husky/pre-commit` to run `bun run lint` instead of `bun test`.
- Made pre-commit hook executable with `chmod +x`.

**Test Results:**

- Pre-commit hook runs `bun run lint` on every commit.
- Commit succeeds when lint passes.
- `bun test` passes (151 tests).
- `bun run build` succeeds.
- `./pace status` works correctly.

---

### Session 51 - Accessibility Review

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- ACC-001: Ensure CLI output is readable (color contrast)

**Actions Taken:**

- Reviewed all CLI output files: `cli.ts`, `src/status-reporter.ts`, `src/validators.ts`.
- Searched for ANSI escape codes using grep patterns (`\x1b\[`, `\u001b\[`, `\033\[`).
- Verified NO color codes are used in the codebase.
- Documented that CLI uses a color-agnostic approach:
  - Unicode symbols (✓, ✗, █, ░) for visual elements
  - Emojis (📊, 📋, 📜, 📝, 📂, 🚀, ✅, ❌, 🔴, 🟠, 🟡, 🟢) for status indicators
  - Plain ASCII for separators (=, -)
- All output uses terminal's default foreground color, ensuring readability on any theme.

**Test Results:**

- `./pace status` output verified readable on terminal.
- `./pace validate` output verified readable.
- `./pace --help` output verified readable.
- `bun test` passes (151 tests).

- Continue with remaining tasks (PERF, STRUCT, CODE, DOC).


---

### Session 52 - Performance Review

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- PERF-001: Review import costs in cli.ts

**Actions Taken:**

- Analyzed all imports in `cli.ts` for startup performance impact:
  - `@opencode-ai/sdk` - SDK has no side effects on import, createOpencode() is deferred
  - `StatusReporter`, `FeatureManager`, `validators` - Local modules, lightweight
  - `loadConfig`, types - Local config, type-only imports (no runtime cost)
  - `fs/promises`, `path` - Node.js built-ins, minimal overhead
  - Markdown imports - Text content only, bundled at compile time
- Measured CLI startup times across all commands:
  - `--help`: ~20ms
  - `status`: ~34ms
  - `validate`: ~37ms
  - `update`: ~33ms
- Verified SDK entry point has no side effects (only exports functions).
- Confirmed dynamic imports are NOT necessary because:
  1. Startup time is already excellent (20-37ms)
  2. Bun's compiler bundles all modules at compile time
  3. Heavy work (createOpencodeServer) is already deferred to runtime
  4. Adding dynamic imports would add complexity without measurable benefit

**Test Results:**

- CLI startup verified < 40ms for all commands.
- `bun test` passes (151 tests).
- `bun run build` succeeds.
- `./pace status` works correctly.

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 50/55
- Known issues: None

**Next Steps:**

- Recommended next feature: STRUCT-001 (Organize imports in all files).
- Continue with remaining tasks (STRUCT, CODE, DOC).


---

### Session 53 - Import Organization

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- STRUCT-001: Organize imports in all files

**Actions Taken:**

- Configured `.eslintrc.json` with `import/order` rule:
  - Groups: builtin, external, internal, parent, sibling, index, type
  - Newlines between groups enforced
  - Alphabetical sorting within groups (case-insensitive)
- Applied import sorting to all source files using `eslint --fix`:
  - `cli.ts` - Reordered imports with proper grouping
  - `pace-plugin.ts` - Removed comment separators, grouped imports
  - `src/feature-manager.ts` - Added newline between groups
  - `src/status-reporter.ts` - Reordered util and path imports
- Updated lint script in `package.json` to include root-level TypeScript files.
- Verified all files pass import order linting.

**Test Results:**

- `bun run lint` passes (no errors).
- `bun test` passes (151 tests).
- `bun run build` succeeds.
- `./pace status` works correctly.

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 51/55

- Continue with remaining tasks (CODE, DOC).

---

### Session 54 - TODO/FIXME Audit

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- CODE-001: Audit codebase for TODO and FIXME comments

**Actions Taken:**

- Searched entire codebase for TODO, FIXME, HACK, and XXX comments using grep and ripgrep.

  - Example project names ("Build a todo app") in CLI help, tests, and docs - NOT actionable
  - Documentation about coding best practices ("no TODOs for core functionality") - NOT actionable
  - SDK feature names (Todo tool/list in OpenCode) - NOT actionable
  - Feature description in feature_list.json - self-referential, NOT actionable
- Verified no actual TODO or FIXME comments exist in source code (cli.ts, pace-plugin.ts, src/*.ts, tests/*.ts).
- No obsolete comments to remove, no actionable items to convert.

**Test Results:**

- `bun run lint` passes (no errors).
- `bun test` passes (157 tests).
- `bun run build` succeeds.
- `./pace status` works correctly (52/55 passing).
