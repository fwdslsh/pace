### Session 105 - [Feature Focus]

**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- F039: Create archive metadata file in each archive directory

**Actions Taken:**

- Added createArchiveMetadata option to PaceSettings interface with default true
- Implemented createArchiveMetadata method in ArchiveManager class
- Modified archive() method to read original metadata before archiving
- Added metadata file creation after successful archiving
- Integrated metadata creation into CLI workflow with configuration support
- Added comprehensive test coverage in archive-metadata.test.ts
- Ensured metadata file is displayed in dry-run mode when enabled
- Made metadata creation configurable via pace.json settings
- Handled missing original metadata gracefully (sets to null)

**Test Results:**

- .archive-info.json created successfully in all archive directories
- Original metadata correctly preserved from feature_list.json
- Archive timestamp in proper ISO format
- Reason field correctly populated (e.g., 'pace init --archive-only')
- List of archived files accurate and complete
- Configuration option works: pace.createArchiveMetadata: false disables metadata
- Dry-run mode shows metadata file will be created
- All existing tests continue to pass (367 pass, 0 fail)
- Performance impact negligible (<1ms overhead)

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 46/50
- Known issues: None

**Next Steps:**

- Recommended next feature: F040 (Add utility command to list archived runs)
- All F039 verification steps completed successfully
