# Session 1: Project Initialization

## Overview
Started the "pace-cleanup" initiative to improve code quality, remove dead code, and introduce linting/formatting standards to the `pace` CLI tool.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Dependencies:** @opencode-ai/sdk, (planned) eslint, prettier

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed existing `package.json` and project structure.
2. Created `init.sh` to handle dependency installation and building.
3. Created `feature_list.json` with 54 granular tasks focused on linting, dead code removal, and testing.
4. Validated `init.sh` execution.

## Next Steps
The next agent should begin by picking a feature from `feature_list.json`, likely starting with the infrastructure setup (INF-001) to install the necessary tooling.

## Current Status
- Project initialized.
- 0/54 features passing.
- Environment ready for "coding-agent".

### Session 2 - Infrastructure Setup

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- INF-001: Install ESLint and TypeScript plugin dependencies

**Actions Taken:**

- Run `bun add -d eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- Verified `package.json` contains new devDependencies
- Verified existing tests still pass with `bun test`

**Test Results:**

- Dependencies successfully installed
- 155 tests passed

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 1/54
- Known issues: None

**Next Steps:**

- Recommended next feature: INF-002 (Create .eslintrc.json)
- Configure ESLint rules and ignore files

### Session 3 - Infrastructure Setup

**Date:** Mon Dec 15 2025
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- INF-002: Create .eslintrc.json configuration file

**Actions Taken:**

- Created `.eslintrc.json` with configuration for TypeScript.
- Verified configuration validity by running `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false bunx eslint` on existing source files.
- Verified positive and negative test cases with temporary files.
- Note: Using legacy `.eslintrc.json` requires `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` with ESLint v9.

**Test Results:**

- Configuration successfully loaded.
- Linting correctly identified issues in `cli.ts` (console.log usage) and intentional errors in test file.
- `bun test` still passes.

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 2/54
- Known issues: None

**Next Steps:**

- Recommended next feature: INF-003 (Install Prettier dependencies)
- Consider automating the `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` env var in scripts (INF-006).
