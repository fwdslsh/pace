**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Agent Type:** Coding

**Feature Worked On:**

- F041: Add utility command to restore archived runs

**Actions Taken:**

- Added 'restore' command to ParsedArgs interface and command parsing logic
- Added timestamp parameter handling for restore command in argument parser
- Added --force flag support for restore command to skip confirmation
- Implemented restoreArchive method in ArchiveManager class with full error handling
- Implemented handleRestore function with confirmation prompt and available archives listing
- Added restore command to help text with examples and options
- Support both human-readable and JSON output formats
- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid timestamps and missing archives
- Created RestoreOptions and RestoreResult interfaces for type safety
- Implemented file existence checking and conflict detection before restore
- Added user confirmation prompt with clear warning about overwriting files
- Verified end-to-end functionality with existing archives

**Test Results:**

- Restore command correctly shows available archives when no timestamp provided
- Invalid timestamp handling works with helpful error message
- Valid timestamp restore lists files to be restored with metadata display
- Confirmation prompt works correctly and can be cancelled
- --force flag successfully skips confirmation and overwrites existing files
- File verification confirms successful restoration of both feature_list.json and progress.txt
- JSON output mode works correctly for both success and error cases
- All existing tests continue to pass (367 pass, 0 fail)
- No regressions in existing CLI functionality

**Current Status:**

- Features passing: 48/50
- Known issues: None

**Next Steps:**

- Recommended next feature: F042 (Add utility command to delete old archives) or F048 (Validate archive directory structure)
